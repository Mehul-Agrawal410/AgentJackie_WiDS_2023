# AgentJackie_WiDS_2023

Welcome to the repository for my WiDS '23 project – "Agent Jackie: Reinforcement Learning Adventures in Kung Fu." In this endeavor, I trained a reinforcement learning model to master the game Kung Fu Master in the OpenAI Gym environment. Below, I provide an overview of the weeks spent on the project, the resources utilized, and the final implementation.

## Week 1: Introduction to Python, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning Basics
This week served as a foundation for our journey, introducing key concepts in Python, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. I delved into essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The assignment for Week 1 involved implementing a linear regression model from scratch, testing it on a dataset provided by mentors. This exercise enhanced my understanding of linear regression, machine learning, and Python libraries.

## Week 2: Multi-Armed Bandit Problem and Algorithms
This week marked our introduction to reinforcement learning and the exploration of the multi-armed bandit problem. I implemented algorithms like Epsilon Greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling to solve this problem. The assignment required us to use provided helper code to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. Thompson Sampling emerged as the best-performing algorithm.

## Week 3: Markov Decision Processes and Value Iteration
This week involved a deeper dive into reinforcement learning and the understanding of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The focus was on the Value Iteration algorithm, which was implemented to plan MDPs for optimality.

## Weeks 4-5 and Final Project: Deep Q Learning for Kung Fu Master
In these weeks, I delved into the Q-learning algorithm, a model-free, off-policy, value-based approach, and its variant – the Deep Q Learning network. The final project involved training a Deep Q Network to excel in the game "Kung Fu Master" within the OpenAI Gym environment.

**Final Project Implementation:** [final.py](https://github.com/Mehul-Agrawal410/AgentJackie_WiDS_2023/blob/main/final.py)

Due to the game's complexity, full training spanned multiple days, and I have provided videos showcasing progress over the initial 30 episodes out of the intended 300.
